Example CRON tab:
     0 * * * cd /srv/Secure/schedule/CreateClassJSON/fromcsv && ./doAll.sh
Dependencies:
    Python:
        xlrd (pip install xlrd --user)
    jq (allows pretty printing of json for emailing diff)
        Not required but extremely useful for seeing what changed
    Download and add to path from https://stedolan.github.io/jq/


For both, make sure is in a PATH which cron can access or hardlink it and make sure have correct permissions
