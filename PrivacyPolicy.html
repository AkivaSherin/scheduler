        This service, the SCCS Scheduler, is offered by SCCS, the Swarthmore College Computer Society, for use by Swarthmore College students (the 'user') in planning their schedule. In order to be most useful, we offer the ability to export your schedule to Google Calendar. This requires the user to authenticate with Google and give SCCS code (which powers the SCCS Scheduler) the ability to interact with the authenticated user's Google Calendar. The interaction consists of only two actions: (1) Create a new Google Calendar named "SCCS Class Schedule" (if it doesn't already exit) (2) Add selected classes to that calendar (removing previously added classes for that semester, if necessary). In order to be able to do both these actions and because of the limited granularity of Google Calendar permissions that Google offers, the SCCS Scheduler needs extensive permissions, including the ability to "See, edit, share, and permanently delete all the calendars you can access using Google Calendar". However, these permissions are <b>not</b> exercised, except for as needed for the two actions above. Furthermore, no data derived from the Google Calendar permission is logged or stored by the SCCS Scheduler in any way, including in the user's browser. All of the JavaScript that is used to interact with a user's Google Calendar is on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/JZL/schedule/blob/master/js/main.js">here</a>.
